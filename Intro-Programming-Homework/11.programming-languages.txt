1. Java
 Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s.
 It's one of the most in-demand programming languages, a standard for enterprise software, web-based content, games and mobile apps, as well as the Android operating system.
 Java is designed to work across multiple software platforms, meaning a program written on Mac OS X, for example, could also run on Windows.

2. PHP
PHP (Hypertext Processor) is a free, server-side scripting language designed for dynamic websites and app development.
 It can be directly embedded into an HTML source document rather than an external file, which has made it a popular programming language for web developers. 
PHP powers more than 200 million websites, including Wordpress, Digg and Facebook. 

3. Python
 Python is a high-level, server-side scripting language for websites and mobile apps. It's considered a fairly easy language for beginners due to its readability and compact syntax, meaning developers can use fewer lines of code to express a concept than they would in other languages.
 It powers the web apps for Instagram, Pinterest and Rdio through its associated web framework, Django, and is used by Google, Yahoo! and NASA.

4. JavaScript
JavaScript is a client and server-side scripting language developed by Netscape that derives much of its syntax from C.
It can be used across multiple web browsers and is considered essential for developing interactive or animated web functions.
It is also used in game development and writing desktop applications.
JavaScript interpreters are embedded in Google's Chrome extensions, Apple's Safari extensions, Adobe Acrobat and Reader, and Adobe's Creative Suite.

5. Objective C
Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language used by the Apple operating system.
It powers Apple's OS X and iOS, as well as its APIs, and can be used to create iPhone apps, which has generated a huge demand for this once-outmoded programming language.


C# is a multi-paradigm language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative.
Combining principles from C and C++, C# is a general-purpose language used to develop software for Microsoft and Windows platforms.
